#Dynamic Consent
A very basic prototype of a Dynamic Consent app developed as part of an internship at the Garvin Institute of Medical Research (KCCG).

This is restricted to an extremely limited scope as only one component of a larger working demo for The GeneTrustee system.

#Scope
- Create Users
- Create Consents
- Delete Users
- Delete Consents
- Update a user's consent

Anything else (user authentication, validation etc) is out of scope for demonstrating functionality.

Strictly speaking, the frontend is out of scope too. But it was fun to make :)

# Setup
For setup instructions, refer to the readmes in the two folders for the front- and backend.
