# Dynamic Consent

A very basic prototype of a Dynamic Consent app developed as part of an internship at the Garvin Institute of Medical Research (Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics).

This is restricted to an extremely limited scope as only one component of a larger working demo for The GeneTrustee system.

## Scope

-   Create users (Done)
-   Delete users (Done)
-   Update a user's consent for:
    -   Organisational type (Done)
    -   Purpose (Done)
    -   HPO if DS-XX (Done)

Anything else (user authentication, validation etc) is out of scope for demonstrating functionality.

Strictly speaking, the frontend is out of scope too. But it was fun to make :)

## Setup

For setup instructions, refer to the readmes in the two folders for the front- and backend.
Proper documentation pending.
